Development tools, also known as DevTools, are a set of features built into web browsers that help developers work on websites more efficiently. Here's how you use them:

1. *Open DevTools*: You can open DevTools by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect", or by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + I" (or "Cmd + Option + I" on Mac) on your keyboard.

2. *Inspect Code*: Once DevTools is open, you can see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of the webpage. You can click on different elements to see their properties and styles.

3. *Debugging*: DevTools is useful for finding and fixing errors in your code. You can set breakpoints to pause code execution and inspect variable values.

4. *Performance Monitoring*: You can use DevTools to check the performance of your website, such as loading time, network activity, and memory usage.

5. *Console*: DevTools has a console tab where you can run JavaScript code, check for errors, and test changes in real-time.

6. *CSS Modifications*: You can modify CSS styles in DevTools and see the changes instantly on the webpage.

By using DevTools, developers can easily inspect their code, find issues, improve performance, and make changes to their websites more efficiently.
